You can also run through the notebook on your own in a Docker container. First, you should install Docker on your local machine (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Second, either git clone or download the workshop repository (https://github.com/compbiocore/rnaseq_workshop_2021). Then, open a terminal window and navigate to the repository folder and pull the container from Dockerhub using this command: docker pull compbiocore/ccv_workshop_rnseqworkshop_2021:latest After that has finished, you can run the container with a command that looks like this: docker run -it -p 8888:8888 --volume $(pwd):/home compbiocore/ccv_workshop_rnseqworkshop_2021:latest Then you can copy and paste the link into your browser.
