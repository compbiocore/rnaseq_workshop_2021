    "\n",
    "The central dogma of biology refers to the concept that in general, biological information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins, which are the molecules that encode for various enzymes etc., that help a living organism maintain homeostasis and self-regulate. For this workshop, we are going to talk about analyzing transcriptome data, where genes are regulated at the level of DNA being transcribed into RNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general experimental process involves extracting RNA from your different experimental conditions, performing the library preparation steps (e.g., cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, and adding adapters). These libraries are sequenced on an Illumina FlowCell. The output from this process is these raw reads (.fastq or .fq files), which you can then align to the appropriate reference genome or transcriptome, where more reads will align to more highly expressed genes. This data can be processed to get back a counts matrix which will let you look at differential expression and perform other downstream analyses.\n",

    "## Computational workflow overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational analysis of an RNA-seq experiment begins from the raw FASTQ files that contain the nucleotide sequence of each read and a quality score at each position. These reads are **aligned** to a reference genome and the alignment files (.SAM or .BAM file) are turned into a counts matrix by programs such as HTSeq or featureCounts. Some newer and very fast alignment-free approaches can also estimate counts per transcript **without alignment**. Instead of directly aligning RNA-seq reads to a reference genome, they perform \"pseudo-alignment\" by assigning reads to transcripts that contain compatible k-mers and generate a table of read counts without the need for a counting step.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rnaseq_workflow.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different programs for running alignment-based quantification. Each alignment program will make different assumptions about the data and will show some variation in performance. For example, not all aligners are 'splice-aware', which means that they will recognize intron-sized gaps that are spliced from transcripts. Some popular alignment-based tools include [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR), [HISAT2](https://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/), [GSNAP/GMAP](http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/), among many others. Counts can be generated from SAM/BAM alignments using programs such as [featureCounts](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/) or [HTSeq](https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/master/). \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"><b>Note:</b> The information you get back from approaches where you are aligning to a transcriptome (like Salmon and Kallisto) will be dependent on the quality of the annotations, which are not always great (especially for non-model organisms). </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Alignment-free tools have gained popularity for their fast performance and low memory requirements while maintaining good accuracy.  The most popular of these tools are [Salmon](https://combine-lab.github.io) and [Kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/). \n",
    "\n",
    "The differential expression analyses introduced here assume you are analyzing a raw counts table, where the rows are the genes or transcripts and the columns are your samples. It is always a good idea to read the documentation for any of these programs to make sure you understand what file formats should be used. The two most popular programs for  differential expression analyses are probably [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2) and [edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/). Each program makes different assumptions and has different approaches to normalizing the data, and they will likely give you slightly different numbers of differentially expressed genes if you run both programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The counts matrices can also be transformed so that they are compatible with common statistical methods for exploratory analysis of multidimensional data, for example clustering and principal components analysis (PCA), which work best for data that have the same variance at different mean values, i.e. the mean and variance are independent.\n",

Simply put, the genes with the highest counts (i.e., those that are more highly expressed) will dominate the analysis simply due to them having more variability.      \n",

One general approach is to visually inspect the PCA bi-plot produced by the `plotPCA` function (i.e., the plot visualizing the samples along the two principal components explaining the most variance). Samples that are outliers will be many of orders of magnitude away from the main group of samples along principal component 1; the difference should be easy to identify visually and usually will not require statistical justification. A second approach is to quantify outliers using z-score standardization. Specifically, you take the principal component 1 values from your PCA object and convert them to z-scores using the following standardization: \n",

    "$x_{gi}$ $\\leftarrow$ $\\frac{(x_{gi} - \\bar{x}_g)}{s_g}$  \n",

To do so, we would access the first principal component from our PCA object using `pcaData$PC1` and standardize these scores using `scale(pcaData$PC1)`. Once you have the standardized scores, outliers can be identified as z-scores greater than 3 or 6 in absolute value, depending on how conservative one wishes to be.\n",
